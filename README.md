OBJECTIVE: 

Build a Car Management Application where users can create, view, edit, and delete cars. 
Each car can contain up to 10 images (specifically of a car), a title, a description and tags - car_type, company, dealer...etc . 
The application should include user authentication, allow users to manage only their products, and provide search functionality across products.
